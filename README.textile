h2. Note of 20140124 : 

This Rails 4 branch is updated to Rails 4.0.2. running on Ruby 2.1.0, and styled with Bootstrap 3.0
This branch is the Rails 4 App for a Membership, Subscription, or SaaS Site.

For original instructions on how to install the app, please see Daniel Kehoe's Master Branch :
!https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas(README.md)!
As this app stands now, it is still using CanCan for authorization.
We intend to can CanCan and put in Pundit.
That's next on the upgrade, commit and push agenda.
