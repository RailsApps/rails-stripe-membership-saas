h4. Note of 20150409 :

This fork is now upgraded to Ruby 2.2.1 and Rails 4.2.1, with RSpec 3.

Rails 4.2 example application demonstrates how to use "Stripe":https://stripe.com/ and the "Payola":https://www.payola.io/ gem  for a Rails membership site, subscription site, or SaaS site (software-as-a-service). Use Daniel's example application as a starter app for your own web applications.

This application replaces a very popular Rails 3.2 implementation, available in Daniel's "Rails 3.2 branch":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas/tree/rails3.2, and now uses the "Payola":https://www.payola.io/ gem.

See the tutorial for a complete explanation of the code:

* "*Membership Site with Stripe*":https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-stripe-membership-saas

This is a complex application. To understand the code, you'll need the tutorial.

The application uses:

* "Payola":https://www.payola.io/ for Stripe integration with Rails
* "Stripe":https://stripe.com/ for credit card payment processing
* "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise for user management and authentication
* "Role-Based Authorization":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-devise-roles for administrator access
* "Bootstrap":http://getbootstrap.com/ front-end framework
