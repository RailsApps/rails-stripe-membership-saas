# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry sets a local environment variable.
# This file overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Gmail_Username'
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
# See http://railsapps.github.com/rails-environment-variables.html
GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Username'
GMAIL_PASSWORD: 'Your_Password'
STRIPE_API_KEY: 'Your_Stripe_API_key'
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: 'Your_Stripe_Public_Key'
